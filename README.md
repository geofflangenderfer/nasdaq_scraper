To update the list of tickers, open EarningsWatchList.xlsx and delete a row you no longer want or add a

To install:
* git clone as normal if you know how
* otherwise, download setup.sh
* open the terminal on your machine
* type the following command: bash Downloads/setup.sh
* this does a lot of the heavy-lifting, and it should make things easier if you
don't normally use the terminal.
